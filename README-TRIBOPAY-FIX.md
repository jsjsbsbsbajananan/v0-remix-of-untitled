# TriboPay Integration Fix - Diagnostic Report

## Problem Summary
TriboPay API accepts our payload but internally fails when connecting to `cashin.safepayments.cloud` with cURL error 35 (SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL).

## Changes Made

### 1. API Endpoint Correction
- **Before**: `https://api.tribopay.com.br/v1/payments`
- **After**: `https://api.tribopay.com.br/api/public/v1/transactions?api_token=TOKEN`

### 2. Payload Structure Update
Updated to match TriboPay's expected format:
\`\`\`json
{
  "amount": 2990,
  "offer_hash": "eb6ulnyxby",
  "payment_method": "pix",
  "installments": 1,
  "cart": [{
    "product_hash": "bsqpr2yfap",
    "title": "Trimestral",
    "price": 2990,
    "quantity": 1,
    "operation_type": 1,
    "tangible": false
  }]
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added specific detection for `cashin.safepayments.cloud` errors
- Return standardized error: `PROVIDER_GATEWAY_ERROR`
- No attempts to bypass or fix provider-side issues

### 4. Retry Logic
- Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s delays
- Maximum 3 attempts for network/timeout errors only
- No retry for 4xx client errors

### 5. Comprehensive Logging
- Request ID tracking for all transactions
- Sanitized logs (no API keys in public logs)
- Timestamp, server region, and stack trace logging
- Development vs production log levels

### 6. Checkout Page Fix
- Updated to use `/api/tribopay/create-payment` instead of `/api/amplopay/create-payment`
- Enhanced error messaging for users

## Environment Variables Required
\`\`\`bash
TRIBOPAY_API_KEY=your_tribopay_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
\`\`\`

## Testing
1. Set your `TRIBOPAY_API_KEY` in environment variables
2. Run the diagnostic script: `node scripts/tribopay-diagnostics.js`
3. Test payment creation through the checkout flow
4. Monitor logs for request IDs and error patterns

## Support Ticket for TriboPay
The diagnostic script generates a complete support ticket. Copy the output and send to TriboPay support with:
- Complete diagnostic logs
- Timestamp of failed requests
- Request IDs for tracking
- Server environment details

## Monitoring
- All requests now include unique `request_id` for tracking
- Enhanced logging captures full request/response cycle
- Provider gateway errors are clearly identified and logged
